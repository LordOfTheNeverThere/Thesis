  abstract = {Summary Copy-number variations (CNVs) are ubiquitous in cancer and
	often act as driver events, but the effects of CNVs on the proteome
	of tumors are poorly understood. Here, we analyze recently published
	genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics datasets made available
	by CPTAC and TCGA consortia on 282 breast, ovarian, and colorectal
	tumor samples to investigate the impact of CNVs in the proteomes
	of these cells. We found that CNVs are buffered by post-transcriptional
	regulation in 23%–33% of proteins that are significantly enriched
	in protein complex members. Our analyses show that complex subunits
	are highly co-regulated, and some act as rate-limiting steps of complex
	assembly, as their depletion induces decreased abundance of other
	complex members. We identified 48 such rate-limiting interactions
	and experimentally confirmed our predictions on the interactions
	of AP3B1 with AP3M1 and GTF2E2 with GTF2E1. This study highlights
	the importance of post-transcriptional mechanisms in cancer that
	allow cells to cope with their altered genomes.},

  pages = {580-589.e4},

  abstract = {Summary Constituents of multiprotein complexes are required at well-defined
	levels relative to each other. However, it remains unknown whether
	eukaryotic cells typically produce precise amounts of subunits, or
	instead rely on degradation to mitigate imprecise production. Here,
	we quantified the production rates of multiprotein complexes in unicellular
	and multicellular eukaryotes using ribosome profiling. By resolving
	read-mapping ambiguities, which occur for a large fraction of ribosome
	footprints and distort quantitation accuracy in eukaryotes, we found
	that obligate components of multiprotein complexes are produced in
	proportion to their stoichiometry, indicating that their abundances
	are already precisely tuned at the synthesis level. By systematically
	interrogating the impact of gene dosage variations in budding yeast,
	we found a general lack of negative feedback regulation protecting
	the normally precise rates of subunit synthesis. These results reveal
	a core principle of proteome homeostasis and highlight the evolution
	toward quantitative control at every step in the central dogma.},
