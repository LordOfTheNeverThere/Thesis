          3. ~~Generalised Least Squares~~
       2. ~~Undestand what other non-linear models to include, if any~~
    2. ~~See if The GLS work will be included in the thesis~~
    3. ~~Do Results~~
    4. Do Conclusions
       1. As a final remark mention the importance of TLS for biological phenoma due to uncertainties in the Y as DR, GE or Protein abundance
          1. Maybe a better model is one like model II but the M is the same as Model V the 5 first PCs
    5. ~~Do Methods~~Yup
       1. ~~Do a chapter with dataset information technicalities, perhaps a table is in order, MV, size, type of variables~~
       2. ~~Describe the various processes, not theretically, simply tell the storyo of what you did~~
    6. Annexes
       1. model biological interpretability
       2. ~~all models~~
       3. ~~All Volcano Plots~~
       4. ~~PValues Histograms~~
       5. ~~Top10 Scatter Plots~~
    7. Glossary
    8.  Acronyms
    9.  Add two schematical figures to make readers understan in a better way what was done (Understand where to put it, either in methods or results)
        1.  The auc global comparison test
        2.  The Sampling 
    10. Use Y = B0 + X + e rather than ~
